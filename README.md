Capstone Hannah Lawson DA9

Executive Summary

For my capstone, I want to look at the performance of Nashville hospitals. I specifically want to look into the results of a patient survey taken at those hospitals. This patient survey was given to a random sample of inpatients inquiring about their hospital experience. Patients were asked to rate each category from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best and 1 the worst. After looking at these results, I will be able to see how these Nashville hospitals stack up against each other. I will also be able to identify an area where they might need to do better when it comes to providing care. In addition to the patient survey, I will also be exploring readmission staus and various emergency room information within each hospital. Can these hospitals provide effective care and keep patients happy? Is there an area that needs to be improved? Are some Nashville hospitals providing better care than others? I will be using Python for data cleaning and Tableau for my presentation. 

Motivation

I have a background in healthcare and I grew up in Nashville so I am familiar with many aspects of the data. I am also very intrested in learning more about data analytics in healthcare so I was really excited to get the opportunity to work with healthcare data. Additionally, being a patient is not always a fun experience, so you may find these insights helpful if you ever need to visit a hospital in the Nashville area. 

Data Question

Are hospitals in Nashville able to provide effective care and keep patients satisfied?
