Capstone Hannah Lawson DA9

Executive Summary
For my capstone, I want to look at the performance of Nashville hospitals. I specifically want to look into the results of a patient survey taken at those hospitals. This patient survey was given to a random sample of inpatients inquiring about their hospital experience.  This breakdown of hospital performance will cover several categories. 
1.	Timeliness of Care
2.	Readmissions
3.	Mortality
4.	Patient Satisfaction
After looking at these categories I will be able to see how these Nashville hospitals stack up against each other. I will also be able to identify an area where they might need to do better when it comes to providing care. However, my main focus will be looking at how Nashville hospitals are performing using the categories mentioned above. Can they provide effective care and keep patients happy? Is there an area that needs to be improved? Are some Nashville hospitals providing better care than others? 

Motivation
I currently live in Nashville so I am familiar with the hospitals I will be looking into. I also work in the healthcare field, so I understand a lot of aspects of the data. I am very interested in healthcare data analytics so I thought it would be a good idea for my capstone to be relevant to that side of things. 

Data Question
Are hospitals in Nashville able to provide effective care and keep patients satisfied? 

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Every hospital in my data is registered with Medicare. Within all the data, there are hospitals from every state and most cities. I will be specifically narrowing that down to data in Nashville, TN. From what I have explored from the data, it seems there are 10 Nashville hospitals. I will then breakdown each hospital and look at them using the four categories I mentioned in the summary. Within each category I will be asking questions. 
1.	Timeliness of Care- What is the average time patients were waiting in the ER? How many patients on average were in the ER? How long were these patients in the ER before a decision was made to admit them as an inpatient? How many patients left the ER before being seen? 
2.	Readmissions- How many patients were readmitted to the hospital after being discharged? 
3.	Mortality- How many patients died from complications after surgery? How many patients died total? 
4.	Patient Satisfaction- How are patients rating their stay at these hospitals? Were their rooms clean? Was the staff responsive? Would they recommend this hospital? 

Data Sources
This data was taken from 2019-2022.
