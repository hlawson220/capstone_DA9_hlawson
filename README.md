Data Question
Are hospitals in Nashville, TN able to perform efficiently and keep patients satisfied?

Executive Summary
This presentation will be taking a look into hospital performance in Nashville. The data question will be answered by looking into patient survey results, emergency room information, and readmission status. From the results, viewers can identify areas where these hospitals are excelling as well as areas that need improvement. 
This data was taken from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and was collected from 2019 - 2022. This data was narrowed down to cover five main Nashville hospitals, they are listed below. I used Python for data analysis and Tableau for visulization. 

Ascension Saint Thomas
Tristar Centennial Medical Center
Tristar Skyline Medical Center
Tristar Southern Hills Medical Center
Vanderbilt University Medical Center

Motivation
I have a background in healthcare, and I grew up in Nashville so I am familiar with many aspects of the data. I am also very intrested in learning more about data analytics in healthcare. I was really excited to get the opportunity to work with healthcare data. Additionally, being a patient is not always a fun experience, so these insights might be helpful if you ever need to visit a hospital in the Nashville area. 

Overall Rating
A patient survey was given to a random sample of inpatients inquiring about their hospital experience. Patients were asked to rate each category from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best and 1 the worst. The overall rating slide will go over each hospital's overall rating from 1 to 5. This slide also includes patient recommendations. This is essentially asking if patients would recommend each hospital to someone else.

Survey Results
This slide goes over the patient survey results in detail. The survey was divided up into several categories and patients once again rated each one from 1 to 5. Below you can find each category description. 
Care Transition - Did patients understand the care they recieved?
Cleanliness - Was the hospital clean?
Discharge information - Did patients understand instructions about their recovery?
Doctor Communication - Did the doctor properly communicate to patients?
Nurse Communication - Did nurses properly communicate to patients?
Quietness - Did patients find their hospital room quiet?
Staff responsivness - Was the staff responsive to the patient's needs?

Emergency Room
This part of the presentation goes over emergency room information for each hospital. Here you can identify two categories, average time spent in the emergency room and the percent of patients that left the emergency room without being seen. The average time spent in the emergency room is listed in hours. This is an averge taken from the time patients got to the emergency room to the time they left. The other category is a percentage that represents the number of patients that for whatever reason left the emergency room before being seen. 

Readmissions
This portion is going to show the readmission rate of patients who were readmitted within 30 days of their initial visit. This value is in percent form.

Conclusion
In short, most hospitals in Nashville are able to perform effectively and keep patients happy. There are some areas where each hospital can improve on. It is my recommendation that each hospital look into those areas and consider making changes.
